-- * These classes are components of a somewhat modified version of
--   `Control.Unification.BindingMonad` from `unification-fd`. It
--   still performs structural unification, but with a few key differences:
--
--     1) It doesn't choke on cyclic terms.
--     2) Provides a rollback mechanism that can still return information
--        from reverted branches of execution.
--     3) Triggers hooks when terms are unified.
--
--   All of these properties are desired if we want to use unification
--   as a significant part of a synthesis process, or as an element in the
--   analysis of inherently cyclic term graphs.
--
--   TODO :: Should we go back to being more explicit about the type of each
--           term in our graph, rather than definingn to be made is about whether we
--          split up the union-find and definitional layers or have them
--          both handled by a single monolith.
--
--          - The former should be more reusable, since we're squishing the
--            term level semantics of a bunch of things down flat.
--
--          - The latter would likely be faster and easier to optimize.
--            I suspect it would be faster to build, but not as simple
--            to manipulate.
