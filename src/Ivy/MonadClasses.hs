-- * These classes are components of a somewhat modified version of
--   `Control.Unification.BindingMonad` from `unification-fd`. It
--   still performs structural unification, but with a few key differences:
--
--     1) It doesn't choke on cyclic terms.
--     2) Provides a rollback mechanism that can still return information
--        from reverted branches of execution.
--     3) Triggers hooks when terms are unified.
--
--   All of these properties are desired if we want to use unification
--   as a significant part of a synthesis process, or as an element in the
--   analysis of inherently cyclic term graphs.
--
--   TODO :: Should we go back to being more explicit about the type of each
--           term in our graph, rather than definingn to be made is about whether we
--          split up the union-find and definitional layers or have them
--          both handled by a single monolith.
--
--          - The former should be more reusable, since we're squishing the
--            term level semantics of a bunch of things down flat.
--
--          - The latter would likely be faster and easier to optimize.
--            I suspect it would be faster to build, but not as simple
--            to manipulate.

  -- TODO :: I'm not confident that we want an equiv operation since
  --        that may break the upwards closed nature of our various operations
  --        It's kinda unclear.
  --
  --   Hell it isn't even clear that the core binding operations need
  --   to be upwards closed in some fashion.
  --
  --   Tells us whether the input terms are equivalent modulo renaming of
  --   free variables. If they are, returns a set of unifications that
  --   need to occur for both terms to be truly equivalent.

--
--   NOTE: A very important note is that when you unify two terms with the same
--         property then the terms those properties point to will also be
--         unified!
--

  --   Keep in mind that the f here isn't actually an error per-se, just
  --   some knowledge that has been gained from the rolled back computation.
  --   E.g. if you're doing CDCL `f` could be a newly learned conflict clause.

  --         better with the push-pop interface of incremental SMT solving.

-- | The default implementation of Attempt for a monad transformer on top of

--
--   If an error is thrown during the attempted action then we revert the
--   action, but allow the error to continue propagating. This seems like
--   the least bad way to handle the problem. The bindings that triggered
--   the error may well be missing due to rolling things back, but at least
--   you're in a coherent state of some sort that you might be able to
--   recover from.
