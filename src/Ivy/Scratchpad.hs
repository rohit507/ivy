-- TODO ::
--    - Property tests
--    - core implementation of unification
--

      -- Consider converting to a typed map, at least early on.
      -- TODO :: Should we keep a graph of term relationships or something?
      --         That would hopefully let us minimize the number of terms we
      --         update, and let us keep better track of subsumption, esp
      --         when a cycle occurs and a sequence of terms should be unified.
      --
      --   - Okay so we get three graphs
      --       - Basic dependency graph w/in a term type
      --       - subsumption graph where cycle detection can lead to the
      --         collapsing of term
      --       - edge-labeled relationship graph which we can use to
      --         project or inject rules when needed.
      --
      --   - What happens if we're strict w.r.t to hooks?
      --       - well, we open ourselves up to infinite cycles or indefinite
      --         expansion of the graph as rules trigger and re-trigger.
      --   - What happens if we're lazy?
      --       - we have to do more work to keep proper track of whether
      --         we have cycles in chains of actions, and them resolve them
      --         somehow.
      --         - So let's walk through that : We have a <- b <- c <- a
      --           we start when b changes and we run the relevant rules
      --           if c is also dirty, then we run through those terms.
      --           if a is dirty then we can run through its rules
      --           well, then we hit b again.
      --           - At which point we notice that b is practically dirty
      --             and move through the relevant steps again.
      --           - Of course, we could be co-inductive and assume that
      --             b is clean and just run one iteration of the cycle.
      --             - when we recurse back to that first call then we could
      --               notice that b was in the set of operations we actually
      --               leaned on our co-inductive assumption.
      --             - And then what? if we notice that we have changed b
      --               we rerun the process?
      --             - well, we could put a counter down and limit the
      --               number of cycles to some parameter?
      --   - Of course laziness needs an additional assumption for it to
      --     be correct which is that no rule will take a bottom and
      --     turn it into something higher than bottom on the lattice.
      -- Sigh :| i need to think about testing all this stuff, especially
      -- ensuring that the partial order / lattice properties are well met.
      -- Likewise, Testing the correctness of hooks would be super nice.
      --
      -- Hooks are going to be the hard part here, since we need to
      -- basically do some silly continuation based stuff that
      -- allows us to split and merge hooks.
      --
      -- So we need a bunch of specific properties for a hook:
      --   it has a nominal breadth and height, where breadth is the number of
      --   parallel actions composed into a single chain.
      --   The height is number of remaining steps in the longest of those
      --   actions.
      --
      -- We need to make sure that, unless an external bind is applied, then
      -- we always reduce the number of steps remaining.
      --
      -- Thankfully, the hook layer should be pretty independent of the
      -- attempt structure, especially when we can just keep an old state
      -- hiding somewhere and swap it in when we mess up. Having that model
      -- hopefully means we don't have to super picky (for now) about keeping
      -- hooks revertible.
      --
      -- So Okay, what can these hooks do?
      --    Unify / Subsume / Bind etc...
      --    Watch for changes in a term, filter on some upwards
      --       closed property
      --    Spawn multiple parallel hooks
      --    Ideally we would be able:
      --        detect that trees are identical and keep from duplicating them
      --        prune action trees that are unachiveable.
      --    hold until a term is subsumed by another, hold until terms are
      --    equal.
      --
      --    I guess there will also probably be some way to update a hook as
      --    bindings change.
      --
      -- Boy oh boy :V and then once that's done we can focus on wrapping things
      -- up neatly. And preventing a lot of single level decomp
