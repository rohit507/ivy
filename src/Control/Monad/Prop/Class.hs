  --    - Can read the lat member associated with a vertex
  --    - can see a single relation associated with the vertex (non-determinism
  --      is handled elsewhere)
  --    - Can add relations to the graph.
  --    - Can define whether lattice members are equal or subsume each other.
  --    - Should only every be upwards closed (i.e it can only increase the
  --      number of vertices or relations in the graph, and only push
  --      lattice values upwards.
  --    - Should die on pattern match failures and guard hitting fail. Other
  --      failures (i.e guards reading bottom) should just cause the transaction
  --      to abort and be reinserted as a hook.
