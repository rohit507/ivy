--          `(JoinSemiLattice e a, JoinSemiLattice e b) => a -> b`)

  --   In addition, this interface will propagate errors that
  --   occur when joining subterms indiscriminately. There are
  --   cases where not propagating an error is the correct choice,
  --   but those will be looked at later.
